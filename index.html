    <h2>The story</h2>
    <p class="firstparagraph"><q>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, "<em class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</em>" The farmer said, "<em class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</em>" The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, "<em class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</em>" The farmer again said, "<em class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</em>"
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, "<em class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em>,</em>" and the farmer responded, "<em class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</em>" The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, "<em class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</em>" Again, he said, "<em class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</em>"
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em>— because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good">good</em> fortune.</q></p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are <em class="good">good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <em class="good">good</em> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
